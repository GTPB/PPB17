## REPEATING THINGS

Already you have coded some pretty repetitive stuff.

Can you suggest what?
<br>
<br>

**Answer ---- the program that went ---- in English:**
```
  Take a string that could be DNA
  Count all the As
  Count all the Cs
  Count all the Gs
  Count all the Ts
  Good job there are only 4 bases say I!!!!
```
<br>
<br>

**What if the string was Protein? I do not want to contemplate the same approach! I want to write ---- in English -----**
```
  Take a string that could be a protein sequence
  For every possible AA code in turn
      Count how many

  Congratulate self on a job well done!
```
<br>
<br>

Unfortunately Python does not understand English –- or even American!!! -- YET!

So there must be some more formal language to define the repetition
This is the topic for now but … first let us consider some different flavours of loop.

```
It is often useful to sketch out your code ideas for a program in informal Natural Language before tackling the rigours of Python (or any other programming language). Code written in Natural Laguge is sometimes referred to as pseudo code. I have no idea why, except I suppose it sounds more... Technical? Tricky? And so helps to keep the uninitiated at a suitable distance.
