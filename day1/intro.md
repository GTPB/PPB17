*At the end of this course you won’t be expert programmers, but “high level beginners”*

Therefore your future as programmers strongly depends on your will to not stop programming when you go back home

*Secret: Having problems the solution of which requires programming*


### We need your help to:

+ start sessions
+ end sessions (recap and feedback)
+ collect feedback
+ write stuff and pin them on the pin board
+ discuss exercise solutions
+ teach

### Hackathon

A **hackathon** (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development collaborate intensively on software projects (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon))
