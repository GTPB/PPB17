#### Solution to challenge #2
```
from math import pi
R = 10.0
V = (4.0/3.0)*pi*(R**3)
print V
```
in this case we import a specific object from math instead of importing the whole `math` module <br>
Advantages: if the module is big and we need only one  function; we not using the "." syntax and the name of the variable pi is shorter!
