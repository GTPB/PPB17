# The Python Shell

In this module you can learn:
+ How to use Python as a pocket calculator
+ How to store data in variables
+  How to import functions from Python modules

Fill in dashed lines with appropriate values using the python interactive shell

```
>>> 1 _ _ 2
>>> 3
>>> 12 - _ _
4
>>> _ _ * 5
20
>>> _ _ ** 2
81
```

```
>>> camels = 9
>>> camels
_ _
>>> silk = camels *  _ _
>> silk
36
>>> math.sqrt(silk)
_ _
>>> math.pow(camels, _ _ )
81.0
```


### The interactive Python shell
You can access the shell by typing `python` in a command-line terminal

```
$ python
Python 2.7.9 (default, Apr  2 2015, 15:33:21)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You can leave the shell with  `Ctrl-D`

> **Challenge #1**
> Open a Python interactive session (the Python shell):
>
>+  Calculate the sum and difference of two
numbers
>+  Divide two numbers. Try 5/3.
>+ Then try 5.0/3
>+  Calculate 3x5
>+  Calculate a power of 2

### Variables
Variables are containers for data.

Variable names may be composed of letters, underscores and, after the first position, also digits.

```
>>> camels = 9
>>> camels
9
>>> silk = camels * 4
>> silk
36
```

### The math module

 Sometimes you need more complex mathematical constants and functions

+  square root
+  factorial
+  sine or cosine
+  pi
+  log

Python groups them together in a text file. You can access them by importing the file.
```
import math
```

Find the matching pairs of functions and x/y values.

### Recap

### The Dogma of Programming

+ First, make it work.
+ Second, make it nice.
+ Third, and only if it is really necessary,
make it fast.
