## Counting amino acids

```
# insulin [Homo sapiens] GI:386828
insulin = "GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCFVNQHLC\
      GSHLVEALYLVGERGFFYTPKT"

for amino_acid in "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY":
  number = insulin.count(amino_acid)
  print amino_acid, number
```
## Repetitive tasks
Consider the solutions of challenge #4 from previous session:

```
dna = "AGCTTCGA"

print dna.count("A")
print dna.count("C")
print dna.count("T")
print dna.count("G")
```
```
dna = "AGCTTCGA"
elem =  dna.count ("A")
print  elem
elem =  dna.count ("C")
print  elem
elem =  dna.count ("T")
print  elem
elem =  dna.count ("G")
print  elem
```

## Loops with for
The `for` command repeats other commands:
```
dna = "AGCTTCGA”

for base in "ACTG":
  print dna.count(base)
```

The commands that are repeated must be **indented (shifted right by four spaces)**.


## Compare
```
dna = "AGCTTCGA”
for base in "ACTG":
  print dna.count(base)
```
Would you prefer this implementation?
```
dna = "AGCTTCGA"

print dna.count("A")
print dna.count("C")
print dna.count("T")
print dna.count("G")
```
Why or why not?

> ####  **Challenge #1**
>
>Retrieve the 1132-residue sequence of human telomerase reverse transcriptase isoform 1 from the NCBI protein database. Choose the FASTA format. Copy the sequence to a text file (`telomerase.txt`). Write a program that reads the telomerase.txt file and prints first the whole sequence and then the sequence residue by residue.

## Use a `for` loop to read a file line by line
```
Input_file = open(“my_file.txt”)
for line in Input_file:
  print line
```

## Look how beautiful it can be…
```
import urllib
url = 'http://www.uniprot.org/\
  uniprot/P12931.fasta'
src_human = urllib.urlopen(url)
for line in src_human:
  print line,
```
